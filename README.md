# Revealer

Revealer is an overlay of [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) designed to easily
create beautiful scientific presentations.

In a mindset close to LaTeX, a presentation is a single text file (`.pres`)
holding both its parameters and its content; media live in an associated folder.
A command-line tool downloads and updates the reveal.js engine and its plugins
for you, and a near-WYSIWYG loop is available inside VS Code.

## Installation

Requires Python ≥ 3.11. [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) is recommended:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CandelierLab/Revealer.git
cd Revealer
pipx install .
```

This installs the `revealer` command, together with all its Python
dependencies (`typer`, `questionary`, `rich`, `tomli-w`, `bibtexparser`) in an
isolated environment — there is nothing else to install by hand.

## Quick start

```bash
revealer root ~/Presentations   # remember where presentations live
revealer new MyTalk             # scaffold a folder + reveal.js + MyTalk.pres
revealer build MyTalk           # generate the HTML
```

Other commands: `revealer open`, `revealer pdf`, `revealer select`,
`revealer list`, `revealer plugins`, `revealer update [--force]`. See the
[CLI documentation](https://candelierlab.github.io/Revealer/cli.html).

## VS Code workflow

With the `Run on save` and `Live Server` extensions, saving a `.pres` file
rebuilds the presentation and the browser reloads it live. Configure *Run on
save* to run `revealer build '${file}'`; see the
[installation guide](https://candelierlab.github.io/Revealer/installation.html).

Perrin branding). Any stock reveal.js theme also works. Select one with
